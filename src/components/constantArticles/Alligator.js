  text: `An average adult American alligator's weight and length is 360 kg (790 lb) and 4 m (13 ft),
  but they sometimes grow to 4.4 m (14 ft) long and weigh over 450 kg (990 lb).
  The largest ever recorded, found in Louisiana, measured 5.84 m (19.2 ft).
  The Chinese alligator is smaller, rarely exceeding 2.1 m (7 ft) in length.
  Additionally, it weighs considerably less, with males rarely over 45 kg (100 lb).
  Adult alligators are black or dark olive-brown with white undersides, while juveniles
  have bright yellow or whitish stripes which sharply contrast against their dark hides,
  providing them additional camouflage amongst reeds and wetland grasses.
  No average lifespan for an alligator has been measured. One of the oldest
  recorded alligator lives was that of Saturn, an American alligator who
  was born in 1936 in Mississippi and spent nearly a decade in Germany before
  spending the majority of its life at the Moscow Zoo, where it died at the age 
  of 83 or 84 on 22 May 2020. Another one of the oldest lives on record
  is that of Muja, an American alligator who was brought as adult specimen to
  the Belgrade Zoo in Serbia from Germany in 1937. Although no valid records
  exist about its date of birth, it is now in its 80s and possibly the oldest
  alligator living in captivity.`,
