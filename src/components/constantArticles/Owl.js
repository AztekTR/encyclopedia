  text: `Owls are birds from the order Strigiformes /ˈstrɪdʒɪfɔːrmiːz/,
    which includes over 200 species of mostly solitary and nocturnal birds
    of prey typified by an upright stance, a large, broad head, binocular
    vision, binaural hearing, sharp talons, and feathers adapted for silent flight.
    Exceptions include the diurnal northern hawk-owl and the gregarious burrowing owl.
    Owls possess large, forward-facing eyes and ear-holes, a hawk-like beak,
    a flat face, and usually a conspicuous circle of feathers, a facial disc,
    around each eye. The feathers making up this disc can be adjusted to
    sharply focus sounds from varying distances onto the owls' asymmetrically
    placed ear cavities. Most birds of prey have eyes on the sides of their heads,
    but the stereoscopic nature of the owl's forward-facing eyes permits the
    greater sense of depth perception necessary for low-light hunting.
    Although owls have binocular vision, their large eyes are fixed in their
    sockets—as are those of most other birds—so they must turn their entire 
    heads to change views. As owls are farsighted, they are unable to clearly
    see anything within a few centimeters of their eyes. Caught prey can be
    felt by owls with the use of filoplumes—hairlike feathers on the beak
    and feet that act as "feelers". Their far vision, particularly in low light,
    is exceptionally good.`,
